	    "Remove user from the board" and then click the red button.

	    on this new page, you will see a link that says home. This will bring you back to 
	    the home page of your project board.

            your mouse, hold down the left click when hovering over the task you wish to move.

	B9) To add an owner click on the drop down list and select a name present in that list and then 
	    click the green button "Add owners". Right below that you will see another drop down list 
	    with owners you can remove from the task. Once you have selected a name from that list, 
	    click the red button "remove owners".

	     "Doing" column. Click on the "Create a new column" button. This will bring you to a new page 
	     where you can enter in a name for said column. Then press the "Add new column!" button. At the
